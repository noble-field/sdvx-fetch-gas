# About
This project is a helper for fetching and managing SDVX charts/scores data.

This helper:
- fetches the latest charts list.
- fetches your scores from official website (need authentication).
- stores the data fetched into your spreadsheet (need authentication).

No client is implemented to manage data.
- Currently, it is assumed to be used in conjunction with AppSheet, SpreadSheet and etc.
- Perhaps, the client may be publicated in the future.

This is a GAS project with [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp).
- All the code are written in typescript.
- The codes pushed to the original project via clasp, they are converted to google apps scripts.
